# infinity-journal
Updated Infinity Journal from Pinkie-Pie, with some fixes and compatibility with Caali's Proxy

This version of Infinity Journal is a very old copy, with fixes done to bring it up to date and with support for Caali's Proxy.

## Command
`journal <name> <province>` : Adds Province and name to travel journal. Must have elite version of journal opened first, then use the command. Province is not mandatory to be added and can be excluded.

## Credits
- [Pinkie-Pie](https://github.com/tera-mods): Original Creator of infinity Journal
- [JustPassingBy](https://github.com/ayylmar/infinity-journal): Rewrite of infinity journal of which some fixes were used in this version.

## Issues
- If you use quick-load, make sure you move at least once after using journal before teleporting somewhere else/using journal again.
